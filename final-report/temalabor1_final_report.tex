\section{Introduction}

%THIS IS THE LAST SECTION WE WILL COMPLETE

In this section, we introduce what the hell we're even talking about, we cite a couple earlier papers which we definitely read and got inspired from, we talk about previous results and so on.

We then talk about how the paper itself is organized, and very lengthily talk about whan kinds of stuff is contained in each section. This is of course for the reader's convenience, and definitely not an attempt to make this paper longer than it should be.

\section{Our data}

Our dataset was acquired directly from the European Parliament's website. It is organized as a \texttt{csv} file which contains entries for each proposed amendment to a law, with information about when the amendment was proposed, some details about the amendment, and more importantly, information about who proposed the amendment, what party they belong to, which EP group said party belongs to, and which country are they are representative of.

This data can therefore be viewed as a bipartite graph, in which one part consists of the MEPs, and the other consists of the proposed amendments. An MEP and an amendment are joined by an edge if and only if said MEP contributed to the amendment (\textit{sponsored} the amendment). Importantly, a single amendment may have multiple contributors, which allows us to analyze the social structure of the European Parliament as a whole.

To analyze the social structure, we \textit{projected} this bipartite graph onto the set of MEPs. This procedure creates a new graph, wherein the nodes represent MEPs, and each edge connects two MEPs which have two contributions in common. (I.e. they \textit{co-sponsored} a bill.)

%% In the future, we're also planning to work with \textit{weighted projections}, which will allow for a more granular analysis of the social network.

\section{Preliminary analysis}

In this section, we talk about the conclusions we can draw from the data while analyzing it in its entirety.

\section{Changes to the social network over time}

In this section, we talk about how we divided the data based on time.

We divided our data based on time. Our goal was to make it possible to analyze the changes in the social environment based on time. We used major events that shaped European politics as breakpoints, because we expected that the social network might change drastically as a result of these events. The most important events we considered were the United Kingdom leaving the European Union (Brexit), on February 1st 2019, and the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24th 2022. These events have undoubtedly shaped public opinion, and our research is centered around finding out whether they also influenced the social structure of the European Parliament.

\section{Conclusion}

The conclusion goes here.
